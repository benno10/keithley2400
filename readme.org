* Keithley2400
A minimal python module to communicate with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter over Serial Interface.

** Setup Requirements
Requires: 
- Python Installation
- python serial module

** Initialization
To use the source meter initialize a Keithley2400 object specifying the port. On Windows use port = 0 for COM1, etc. On a Mac use "/dev/..."


** Voltage Measurement
To measure a voltage first call setupVoltageMeasurement().
To get a voltage reading call read().


** Voltage Source
To use the source meter as a voltage source, go through the following process:
- Initialize the interface
- Reset the device
- Set the source functionality to voltage
- Set the voltage.

This process is performed if the module is run on the command line.
